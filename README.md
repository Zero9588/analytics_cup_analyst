#### Introduction
Pressure Point is a defensive analytics web application designed to explain how teams apply pressure and who truly drives it. Rather than relying on generic intensity or distance metrics, the app breaks down pressing and pressure at both team and individual level using detailed on-ball engagement data. By separating individual pressure actions from collective pressing chains, Pressure Point reveals the structure, responsibility, and effectiveness of defensive behaviour within a match.

The focus is not on abstract tactical labels, but on observable actions: who engages the ball carrier, whether that engagement is isolated or part of a team press, and what outcomes those actions produce.

#### Usecase(s)
Pressure Point supports several core analytical questions. Player Pressure Profiles summarise how often players engage opponents, distinguishing between individual pressure and involvement in team pressing chains, and linking those actions to outcomes such as forcing backward passes, stopping danger, or reducing threat.

Press Setter Share identifies who sets the press—the players initiating team pressing chains—and where on the pitch those actions occur, providing insight into defensive leadership and positional responsibility.

Press Break analysis highlights moments where players fail to engage during an active team press, helping analysts identify weak links or breakdowns in collective behaviour.

Finally, clustering groups players into pressing archetypes based on their engagement patterns, revealing distinct defensive roles within the same team structure.

#### Potential Audience
Pressure Point is built for professional analysts, coaches, and recruitment staff seeking a deeper understanding of pressing behaviour. It also serves students and data practitioners who want a clear, structured way to interpret defensive actions beyond raw physical output, making complex pressing dynamics easier to analyse, compare, and communicate.
